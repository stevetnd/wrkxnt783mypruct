      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Samantha “Sam” has been a licensed Realtor for 13 years. She began her Real Estate career in TX, and as of 12 years ago made the move with her husband and 3 children to Arizona. Her husband is the Director of Tennis at Arrowhead Country Club located in Glendale. It was through this time period that Sam was able to learn different parts of the Valley and many Strategic Partners along the way. 3 Years ago, after making a family decision to stay permanently and not move back to Texas she obtained her Real Estate license here.</p>
      <p>Sam now has 2 additional children… YES totaling 5. Their ages are: 19,17,15,4,1. She is also the proud dog mom of Zepplin “Zep”. Sam has a true servant heart and appreciates working with people. Her biggest passion is assisting during the home buying and selling process because “ a home will be one of, if not THE biggest transactions you do within your lifetime! It is critical to do this process with someone who can help you make the best educated decisions you can, so that you look back and can be proud of what you have done and where you are!”  She does not take the trust her clients give her for granted. She has a strong sales and marketing background 18 years in the making. She has built her business success through relationship building. In addition to selling real estate; taking great pride in strategic partner relationships she has built. This allows her to be more than just a “Realtor”. She is able to refer other quality driven and like minded value local business owners to her clients and prospects.</p>
      <p>Sam is an active member of WEMAR (West Valley Association for Realtors), and actively participates on committees.She is a member of NAR (National Association of Realtors) and METROTEX (The Dallas Texas Association Of Real Estate). She is an AZCREW Member  (Commercial Real Estate Association) that has a strong education emphasis and sits on the Professional Development Committee. Sam is a past Board Member of BOMA (Building Owner and Management Association) and was active committee chair for 7 of the 10 years she participated.</p>
      <p>Some of the Real Estate awards she has received throughout her career; Volunteer of the year, Committee Chair of the Year, Philanthropic Volunteer, and Top Producer.</p>
      <p>Now for the personal things. Sam love to read, cook, scrapbook and network in her spare time. She enjoys spending quality time with her family and friends.  A fun fact: She is a blogger and has been for 9 years. She started a website called JustWalkInFaith that was created to help inspire others to share their stories through her vulnerable writings. In addition to English she is also fluent in Spanish.</p>
      <p>She does not seek to work with clients just one time, she creates a relationship for life! “ To be a part of someone’s life in a way that allows you to celebrate their home purchase and other wins in life is something not to be taken lightly! To be there in time of loss too ( the good and the bad).So many of my clients are for life. I have seen them get married, have children, move somewhere for work, and downsize for reasons… to say you get to be a part of a life that way… WELL WOW! How amazing is that?!”</p>
