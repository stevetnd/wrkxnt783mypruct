                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Leslie was born and raised in New England and lived there all of her life until she moved to Grovetown, GA in May 2006. “I get asked alot about why I moved here. The answer is simple: to get away from the cold, long winters, the high home prices and property taxes.” Leslie adds “I should have been born in the South, as I love it here.”</p>
                <p>Leslie obtained her Bachelor’s Degree from Southern New Hampshire University and worked in Human Resources as a primary recruiter in the healthcare industry for a number of years prior to her move to the South. “Working in Human Resources taught me how important it was to listen attentively to others.”</p>
                <p>“I moved to the South when my two children were young. So, I initially took some part-time jobs to get us out of the house. When they got older I searched to find something that would be conducive to a child with a chronic health condition. That is when I started my organizing business, All About Organizing which was closed in 2015.”</p>
                <p>Real Estate has always been on Leslie’s mind. “I had really wanted to get into real estate about 10 years prior. But, I know the rigors of making phone calls and meeting clients to show houses were not conducive to having younger children. Leslie got her break into Real Estate by working on the Contract-to-Close for a Realtor® at Keller Williams in Augusta. “This experience was invaluable to me because I learned about contracts, disclosure, etc… This stuff isn’t taught in the Real Estate Schools, so it was helpful I had that knowledge going in.” After a little over a year in that role, Leslie, took the licensing exam and became a Realtor®.</p>
                <p>Leslie, works for Method Real Estate Advisors in Evans, GA, and truly loves what she does. Since December of 2018, Leslie has closed 22 deals for a total of 5.3M. When others ask her what she does to be successful. Her reply, “I just be myself. I’m caring and concerned by nature, so when I talk to people on the phone, it’s like they are my best friend. That is how I treat everyone. Leslie joined the Teacher Next Door Program to give back to her community.</p>
