                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I became a Realtor® in 2009, during the recession, I never imagined that a decade later I would be “leading, as President of one of the largest, most important organizations on the Mid Shore, covering Realtors in Dorchester, Talbot and Caroline Counties,” The Mid-Shore Board of Realtors®(MSBR)Today, I consider myself a successful entrepreneur and licensed Realtor®. I opened my own Brokerage in 2018, The Property Shoppe. I own and operate the brokerage, I own a Referral company and Property management firm in Cambridge, MD as well. As immediate-past President of MSBR, I continue to open doors: I was the first African American to serve as President of the Mid-Shore Board of Realtors® in its 67-year history along with several other firsts'. During Covid-19, The Property Shoppe continues to show and sell and list properties as Realtors® and Real Estate Brokerages are considered “Essential Businesses”. We do business a little differently but nonetheless, we get you to the ultimate goal of homeownership. I Officially became a certified At Home With Diversity Realtor® (AHWD) in October in 2019. Fair Housing is very important to me and anything that I can do to bring awareness and consciousness of it, I will! I earned my certification after completion of the AHWD course which addresses topics of diversity, fair housing and business plan development. I know the importance of adapting and remaining relevant in today’s marketplace. By developing a business practice rooted in inclusion and equality, we as Realtors® can help buyers of all cultural backgrounds achieve the dream of homeownership. The At Home With Diversity certification course covers how to work effectively with diverse populations to build business success in today’s multicultural real estate market. As the Property Shoppe continues to grow, I have made it mandatory for all agents within my Company to take the course and receive the AHWD certification, to meet and exceed the needs of all cultures. I am passionate about my Profession and Community. She is a Cambridge native and mother of five. Together with her husband Elbert, the Greens raised their family – which now includes eight grandchildren – while operating multiple businesses. We have invested in our community by acquiring and maintaining investment properties. For two decades, I had worked as a paralegal and administrator for local government agencies including the Dorchester County State's Attorney’s office, in which she was the first African American Legal Assistant. While I am a former County employee turned successful entrepreneur, I had initially embarked on a different path, but was always interested in Real Estate. In her twenties, I and my best friend exercised daily by walking through Cambridge’s neighborhoods. They’d often stop to admire homes with sale signs on front lawns. After my husband and I purchased our first home in 2006, I realized that our lack of education about the home buying process resulted in an unfavorable loan... I have worked hard to educate myself on other options and retired the portion of her high interest rate in just four years by paying off the loan. Our home buying transaction inspired me to pursue my real estate license to ensure that this would not happen to anyone else. While fear and negative energy from others held me back initially, I overcame the mental hurdles and put a plan in place and realized my dream and purpose. I am proud to be the first Female-African American Broker in Cambridge and one of a handful of women who have built successful real estate companies on the Shore. Several hundred clients have listed their homes, bought and sold homes with me since becoming a Realtor®. My niche market is first-time home buyers, homes for men, veterans and investors but not limited to any real estate transaction including commercial sales.“ First and foremost, I work to educate the community, buyers and sellers. I also take time to help individuals become credit worthy and work to promote the sale of dilapidated properties in the community, which can be totally renovated with home renovation loans. From beginning to end, I enjoy the process of helping people purchase and sell properties. I love showing homes and look forward to when I get to say “Congratulations, you got the house!” It is an amazing feeling knowing that I helped a buyer accomplish the most important and most expensive purchase of their lifetime.” My vision for The Property Shoppe is to become a well-known local/Maryland Real Estate Company. Future plans are to branch out and open offices in neighboring cities and counties.” I currently hold two Broker Licenses. I intend to help the County grow and to encourage and inspire others to live and invest in the Community. Living in Dorchester County and the ability we have to raise our families in a close-knit atmosphere is amazing. I enjoy walking the streets of Cambridge, driving along the waterfront, the country roads, and taking in the history and the beauty of our town. It inspires me when I get to drive potential buyers, who are not locals, around Cambridge to show them the beautiful sites in our community. I love the reaction from visitors who repeat ‘it’s so beautiful and peaceful here.” Buying a property in Dorchester County is affordable.” Living in Cambridge is serene.
