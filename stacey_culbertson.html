      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Stacey Culbertson is a professional realtor who takes pride in her knack for connecting her clients with "their" perfect home. Stacey has never met a stranger and is gifted in her ability to relate to people of all walks of life. She has always been an outgoing "people person" with a bright smile. Stacey was born and grew up in the melting pot, New York City....She's loves meeting new people and when the opportunity presents itself, to lend a helping hand to those in need. Stacey moved to Florida in 1998, and again relocated to Georgia in 2008. It was there, she met and married her husband, they have 3 beautiful daughters between them. They are active members of their church, dedicating significant time volunteering in various outreach programs within their community. Stacey also serves as a Vacation Bible School teacher for pre-school age students at their church. Stacey loves animals and runs her own informal rescue, saving one animal at a time. They have 2 dogs, and 3 cats (new kitten being most recent rescue) who they consider part of their family.</p>
      <p>Stacey enjoyed a 15 year career in Corporate America working in various administrative roles within fortune 500 companies. Very articulate and skilled in effectively communicating difficult concepts, she has often found herself on the front line of communications for her employers. She later transitioned into a career within the medical field becoming a licensed Nurses Technician and Medical Assistant. This is where her compassion for people in need was fulfilled in a big way. Stacey enjoyed going that extra mile for her patients. Whether it be staying late to ensure an elderly person who couldn't feed themselves, ate, or spending extra time, on her own time with a patient she knew just needed someone who cared. Her medical training and love for her family compelled Stacey to put her own life on hold, to also care for her Mother, Uncle, and Grandmother in their final stages of terminal illness within a 12 year span.</p>
      <p>This same passion for people later led Stacey into a career within the State of GA's Department of Family and Children's services. It was there she again connected with all walks of life, and enjoyed her role as an Economic Support Specialist who approved and connected applicants for services they needed. Her clients often wrote letters of appreciation for her in some cases, being the only case worker who actually listened to their needs and went out of her way to help them. Never judging or making anyone feel less adequate but ensuring them anyone can fall on hard times. Due to many transitions within the organization not aligning with her ideologies, Stacey ended her career with DFCS, and decided NOW is my time...</p>
      <p>Stacey always had a curiosity and fascination for the real estate industry and decided to embark upon her own career in the field. Impressed by all of the knowledge her own previous realtor brought to the table when her and her husband purchased their home, she knew she could also do this...Her passion for helping people intersecting with her bubbly personality, and efficiency in her work ethic, is the recipe for her success! She works hard for her clients and effectively negotiates great deals on their behalf. Her heart for serving people will be essential in her role as your Premier Agent! She is ready to work and excited to assist you in your home buying experience!</p>
