      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Trisha and Max Tannis are the owners of OWNiT Realty AZ and combined have over 30 years in residential real estate and education.</p>
      <p>Trisha is the designated broker and has built a solid reputation as tireless advocate for her clients. Trisha is the designated broker and has built a solid reputation as tireless advocate for her clients. She originally obtained her broker’s license in 2008 and has had a great opportunity to work with many homeowners and buyers alike. From short sales, REO, residential resale and new homes sales Trisha has built her reputation as a subject matter expert. The key to her success has been education and she has held positions as a certified trainer in Real Estate to provide continuing education for agents on our forever changing Real Estate climate. Max is passionate, driven, client focused and a solution finder. He has spent many years working in real estate & relocation assisting our clients with long distance relocation and the last 10 years with educators and other public service members. He is a U.S. Navy veteran and proudly served our country during Desert Shield. Both Trisha and Max are designated and preferred Realtors® with the "Teacher Next Door" program and understand the challenges that inherently come with residential transactions. Having worked with clients on both sides of the real estate world they are able to anticipate things before they occur and plan accordingly. They are both licensed members of the National Association of Realtors (NAR), members of the Arizona Regional Multiple Listing Service (ARMLS) and an active members of the South East Valley Regional Association of Realtors (SEVRAR).</p>
      <p>Max and Trisha began to notice the lack of support given to those who support our communities the most and decided to be a different kind of real estate company. One that values our community leaders and is dedicated to helping those that help others. Their primary focus is to provide quality service and support to our local communities and those who serve it. As your real estate agents they are YOUR advocates! Whether you are buying, selling, or renting, they work vigorously to promote your best interests.</p>
      <p>When not assisting clients, Max and Trisha enjoy spending time with their family and entertaining friends. One of their favorite things to do is to explore. Whether it is traveling to other parts of the world or finding interesting local restaurants/venues they love to experience all that communities have to offer.</p>
      <p>They call it "The Max and Trisha’s adventures"</p>
