          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>What if there was a Real Estate company that took the time to listen to YOUR NEEDS & YOUR GOALS? What if you could find a company that earned your trust by providing you with Stellar Professional service everyday throughout your entire buying transaction? Welcome to such a Team! Let me introduce you to the Synergy Group at Platinum Realty. We use the very latest marketing methods while providing good old-fashioned personal service! We are not your typical cookie cutter; big box realtors. We do not put every client on the same conveyor belt and run them through a stagnant outdated system.</p>
          <p>I began my career with such a cookie cutter company. I quickly realized that was not how I wanted to do business with my clients and began a search for a company that offered a better way. In 2017 I found such a company in Platinum Realty. In 2010 Platinum was recognized as the fastest growing real estate company in America by Inc. 5000. In 2019 our Founder was selected to serve as one of the 75 National Directors for the National Association of Realtors Board of Directors! No other firm in Oklahoma was recognized. Having our company represented on a national scale is indeed a great accomplishment I am proud of!</p>
          <p>Real Estate has most definitely become my passion! I enjoy meeting new clients and discovering what their needs and goals are. Being able to resolve their needs, and achieve their goals is one thing that sets me apart from all those cookie cutter realtors. No one likes being told, “It is what it is, this is just how we do business.” At Synergy Group we think and thrive; “Out of the Box”!</p>
          <p>The way I see Real Estate is simple. If you are like most people, buying a home is the biggest financial transaction you will ever make. So why hire someone who isn’t as totally into the Game as you are? I understand what is happening here; you may be buying your first home, and this is going to become your nest egg that you will use to create your financial future. Or; you may be at retirement age & you’re looking to sell that home now that it is paid off & downsize into something smaller. Whether you're buying your 1st home or your next one; I understand that this is a HUGE financial step. I look forward to the opportunity to work with you.</p>
