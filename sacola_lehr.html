                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My husband and I worked hard for many years, but we weren't saving much. We both had relatively good paying state jobs but there wasn’t much left to put into savings at the end of the month. For a while we wondered what we were doing wrong. Finally, we got serious and started using Dave Ramsey's 7 Baby Steps to become debt free. We followed baby steps 1 and 2 obediently. Within two years we not only paid off all of our debt but we had an emergency fund and enough money to put down on our very first home. We didn't have a clue about homeownership. We were property virgins!</p>
                <p>We were skeptical to work with brokers, because of the horrifying experiences we’ve heard over the years. Sparse communication, lack of transparency, not enough clarity.</p>
                <p>We were told that most real estate brokers were only after commissions. We felt hopeless and we didn’t know where to look.</p>
                <p>We wanted a similar experience that our friends had. Someone who was going to educate us in the home buying process. Someone who would be an advocate for us as first-time homebuyers. omeone who took the time to get to know our wants, needs, and desires in finding the right home for us.</p>
                <p>The first thing they said when I made the call was to suggest that we meet for a buyer's consultation. We had no idea what that would entail, but to our great surprise they were able to provide us with the information that we needed to get started. Our consultation also gave us a great opportunity to know how we can successfully work with real estate agents. They gave us a foreshadow of what we could expect during a transaction to lead us to buying our first home in that one consultation. They also made an exception for us, because they did Wondering about financing wasn’t going to be an issue. (Thanks again Dave Ramsey!)</p>
                <p>In the beginning, we were pretty certain about getting pre-qualified with our local credit union. However, our brokers educated us on the difference between being pre-qualified versus being pre-approved in the current real estate market. They also gave us advice on to how to make an attractive offer to a seller. Since they were the experts and had more experience with current market trends, we followed their advice.</p>
                <p>We’re so happy that we did!</p>
                <p>It took us six weeks to house hunt, make an offer, go under contract, settle, and close, which is record time in the home buying process!</p>
                <p>My personal experience motivated me to run my own real estate business. My mission is to ensure that my home buying clients have a similar experience that my family had. I want this for first time home buyers and families.</p>
                <p>Now as a NC REALTOR® I understand and know that when working with clients it is imperative to be a good listener, educate, advise, be honest, transparent, and connect myself with professionals who will get things done for my clients. And as a future client I want the same experience for you.</p>
