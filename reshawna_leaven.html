          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>ReShawna Leaven is a real estate advisor with Keller Williams Realty Kingstowne, a local real estate brokerage in Kingstowne (a sought after area in Alexandria). A residential real estate industry expert in Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia (DC). Two decades of residing the area, she is aware of upcoming changes within the area that will indirectly or directly impact her clients. With over numerous transactions under her belt, she has learned that education is just as important as the sale itself. She is a real estate educator and committed to better serve her client base and people who may want to become new agents.</p>
          <p>Her motto is "Without the proper guidance and education a transaction can cost someone thousands of dollars in heartache and legal fees. An agent not educating their clients on the process and clear expectations is like real estate malpractice.” It's her pledge, duty and responsibility to abide by the standards of the National Association of Realtors Code of Ethics.</p>
          <p>She has a team of local professionals and continues to analyze area market trends, recent home sales, rental activity, tour resale and new construction homes, collaborate with lending professionals to learn the best mortgage programs available, so she can illustrate the differences and possible challenges in the current market.</p>
          <p>Over the past decade, technology has transformed the real estate industry. ReShawna has incorporated and become a true tech-savvy agent with a mobile app, online screen sharing, electronic signatures, digital contracts and other tools for a smooth client experience. Communication is key and she uses technology to update her clients by email, phone or text message.</p>
          <p>While serving a wide variety of clients to include buyers, sellers, investors, corporations and lending institutions, her greatest enthusiasm is for first time home buyers. She states that “It’s the beginning of a new life and building wealth for Americans. My mission is to help end the gap between renting and homeownership.” A detailed consultation for buyers with a budget analysis, market trends and real estate future outlook of homeownership assists with making solid decisions for their budget and prevent future hardship. Yearly she publishes an online magazine that showcases programs for first time home buyers to investors.</p>
          <p>In her free time, she runs several Meetup groups as the organizer in the DC area to collaborate and fellowship with local residents. She considers herself a “true foodie” also enjoying hidden gems and supporting local businesses.</p>
          <p>Clients choose to work with ReShawna because she puts them at ease from the beginning and after closing with her experience and knowledge to get them to their desired result. With a coverage area from Fredericksburg to Baltimore she is abreast on all markets. Real estate is always localized and it's important to know "now" and "future" trends of a buyer, seller or neutral market.</p>
          <p>ReShawna has a large coverage area throughout the Washington Metro Area to include the City of Alexandria & Fredericksburg, Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, Prince William, Stafford Counties in Northern Virginia, City of Baltimore, Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Calvert, Charles, Prince George’s, St. Mary’s, Montgomery Counties in Maryland and District of Columbia.</p>
