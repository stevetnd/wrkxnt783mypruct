      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I first endeavored into this industry in 2006 as a Property Manager for two years. For the past 12 years, I've worked my way through our industry, learning all of the ins and outs, and gaining the skill set needed to ensure my clients always get the best delegation in the process of buying, selling, and investing. I can sit here and tell you I have strong negotiating skills, local market knowledge, and so forth – and of course, I do – but one thing I want to share with you, the thing that is the most important tool I can provide you in your home sale or purchase is my passion. I didn't get into the industry to make money. I got into the industry because I fell in love with it. I fell in love with homes, the character each one had, and the beautiful people I got to help transition from one to another. I fell in love with hearing people's stories, really getting to know their needs for their futures, and focusing on ensuring you found a home that actually met those future goals. Real estate can be a stressful thing, moving out of a home you've known for years can be hard, and it can be harder if you don't have someone to partner with who doesn't take the time to understand that.</p>
      <p>My business goes beyond the professionalism I can bring to the table, my years of knowledge about our local market and communities, and past the number of sales I've made thus far. Instead, it prioritizes you. How much can you afford? What motivates your move? What do you HAVE to have to make this big transition in your life? You need a real estate agent who understands that and seeks to know the answer to those questions and all of the other important ones that make buying and selling a reality for you. Let's grab coffee or lunch, on me, and we'll talk about your real estate goals. I'll get to know your needs, I'll share the amazing experience I can provide, and we'll make sure your next move is in the right direction. You don't need a computer to find your dream house, you need a professional partner who has your best interest at heart from the moment you call to even after we close. I'm doing more than just selling houses in Columbia, SC, and the surrounding areas; I'm helping you bring your dream home to life.</p>
