      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>What’s up Arizona! My name is Diante Richardson, and I am here to serve your real estate needs with the highest level of professionalism, efficiency and competitive spirit. Whether you’re buying your dream home or selling your property to an eager buyer, I’m your man! I’m geared up and ready to assist you in all capacities our industry has to offer, such as commandeering rental and investment properties, condos, townhomes, land, and apartments. My focus is on the Greater Phoenix Metropolitan Area including, but not limited to: Phoenix, Tempe, Scottsdale, Laveen, Tolleson, Surprise, Glendale, Avondale, Peoria, Goodyear, and Litchfield Park.</p>
      <p>I am ecstatic to be part of the EXIT Realty Expanded Vision team. This amazing Brokerage welcomes REALTORS® and clients in as family and they possess the same level of genuine care and concern for our clients and surrounding community. Utilizing cutting-edge marketing tools and technology, in combination with top of the line training, I am confident that we will not only satisfy needs, but also surpass any expectations you have for your investment in real estate. Our well-disciplined team of professionals work collectively toward reaching the goals of our clients in the most effective, efficient and swift manner possible. You can rest assured you are in great hands here at EXIT.</p>
      <p>A little about myself, I come from a long line of Military Veterans allowing me to see much of our beautiful country and abroad at a young age. In 2003, my mother settled in at Luke Air Force Base where I attended both Jr High and High School in the beautiful and rapidly expanding city of Surprise. During my tenure at Valley Vista HS, I was my school’s Varsity Quarterback. I continued my passion for football, accepting a scholarship to Widener University in Chester, PA (Greater Philadelphia Area) where I earned my Bachelors of Arts in Communication Studies with a focus on Broadcasting. Originally intending to be a television anchor, I parlayed my speaking skills and fun-loving personality into an extensive career in sales, marketing and customer service where my true passion for working with people resides.</p>
      <p>I am an active member of Kappa Alpha Psi, Fraternity Inc. where I garnered the characteristics of promoting honorable achievement in every field of human endeavor, as well as the fortitude to inspire service in the public’s interest. When I am not vigorously finding your new home, I enjoy staying active with my adult flag football team, working out, and hiking. I also spend time actively strengthening my faith and mentoring youth in our inner-city communities, while becoming well versed in the entrepreneurial sector.</p>
      <p>It would be my esteemed pleasure and honor to assist you in making your home buying or home selling experience truly amazing! I look forward to building a lasting relationship and helping you to fulfill your real estate dreams. Contact me, Diante Richardson, at 602-299-2741 or via email at DRichardsonHomes@gmail.com. You can also download my mobile business card by texting “DRich” to 85377. Thank you!</p>
