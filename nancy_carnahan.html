                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Nancy Troxell Carnahan is an original Valley Girl, minus the quirky mannerisms or clipped speech patterns. Born and raised in the San Fernando Valley, she earned a Bachelor of Arts Degree in 1988 from California State University, Northridge. She was 23 years old when she moved in 1990 to the Santa Clarita Valley and became a licensed sales associate. Career milestones included recognition as the “Best in Real Estate” in the Santa Clarita Valley in 2003, an honor bestowed by the San Fernando Valley Business Journal. In 2008 she was inducted into the RE/MAX International Hall of Fame.</p>
                <p>She was instrumental in development of the early adoption of electronic signatures and paperless transactions that culminated in the creation of a transaction management platform called BrokerTransactionManagement (BTM), which is in use today by the BrokerInTrust network, of which she is a co-founder.</p>
                <p>Nancy Troxell Carnahan earned her “Broker” license in 2011. Within two years, she and her partners had The BrokerInTrust Real Estate Network fully operational. It’s a novel, invitationonly, real estate model that connects clients with vetted, experienced professionals. The BrokerInTrust model uses zero inexperienced agents, guaranteeing only top Brokers serve clients. She also has earned the Senior Real Estate Specialist designation, which provided the understanding and foundation to satisfy the housing needs of aging individuals.</p>
                <p>Troxell Carnahan is deeply committed to organized Real Estate, a passion that has contributed to a depth of knowledge that continually benefits her clients and distinguishes her from competitors who have a narrower vision. REALTOR® trade associations are one of the most influential voices advocating at all levels of government for private property rights.</p>
                <p>Since 1996 she has served in virtually every capacity at the Southland Regional Association of REALTORS®, which serves the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, and the California Association of REALTORS®. She is a current member of the Boards of Directors of both organizations, and is the 2020 President of the 10,300-member Southland Regional Association of REALTORS®</p>
                <p>She moved back to the San Fernando Valley in 2015. Her hobbies include tennis, snow skiing, playing guitars, and spending time with her husband, her kids and her grandkids.</p>
