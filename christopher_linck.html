                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Christopher is a west coast native, he was born in the rural farmland of Visalia, California, where his aunt and uncle ran the only high school dairy this side of the Mississippi. Chris graduated high school in Oregon. After moving to the Tri-Cities he continued his education at Columbia Basin College and has called the Tri-Cities home for nearly 20 years.</p>
                <p>Christopher is a proud member of the United States Marines. His position as a Marine Sniper has allowed him to attend some of the best schools the military has to offer. During Christopher’s final tour in Iraq his company came under intense attack, Christopher’s team was dispatched to combat the enemy snipers, which is where he was struck in the neck by enemy gunfire. Unfortunately, his injuries were too severe for him to continue his service in the United States Marines.</p>
                <p>When Chris’ time in the Marines came to an end, he still had a desire to serve his country in any capacity that he was needed. He decided to move back home to Tri-Cities and is actively working to bring awareness to the care of veterans and helping them find a purpose in their local communities.</p>

He decided to move back home to Tri-Cities and is actively working to bring awareness to the care of veterans and helping them find a purpose in their local communities.</p>
                <p>Christopher’s love for Real Estate started as a child; he moved around so much that he often dreamt of having his own bedroom and yard to play in. When he returned to the Tri-Cities he used his VA benefits and life savings to buy his first home. He now lives in Pasco with his wife and their 4 Children.</p>
                <p>Christopher knows first-hand what the true meaning of home ownership is really all about. The pride and satisfaction it brings, and the safety and security it gives you, knowing you have a place to rest. Finding a career that allows him to help other people find their home, brings a lot of joy to him.</p>
                <p>Years of service in the military and working with a team in high pressure situations has given Christopher a unique set of skills. Strong communication, attention to detail, and a desire to continually train and learn in this industry, keeps Christopher up to date and well rounded to serve his clients. He is an expert negotiator and he prides himself on his integrity. These skills make the process of buying or selling much smoother for his clients. Plus, having lived in the Tri-Cities for almost 20 years he has a great feel for our area and can really help match your lifestyle needs and wants, with the location that best fits you!</p>
