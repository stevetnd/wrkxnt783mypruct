              <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Wendy Herst is a successful real estate agent with a proven track record in helping both buyers and sellers in Arizona, including ranking in the top 1% of agents in the state. She takes a concierge approach to helping her clients and operates from the principle of “this real estate journey is about you, and YOU come first!”</p>
                <p>Wendy has handled hundreds of relocations in her career and also has experience in Family Office real estate. She enjoys complex transactions and creative solutions and leverages her background in economics and business to evaluate what makes real estate valuable - from location to municipal growth plans. She considers local trends and macroeconomic factors and stays current with real estate news to better assess market conditions.</p>
                <p>When working with a seller who has entrusted her to sell his/her home, Wendy takes it as seriously as if it was her own home and feels the imperative to get the home sold. She helps clients in preparing their home for sale from a property staging perspective as well as other strategic and tactical pre-listing techniques. She is known for her proactive sales and marketing protocols, online presence, and partners with many allied vendors in a team approach to helping you through the home-selling journey.</p>
                <p>When working with a buyer, Wendy has a talent for helping buyers hone in on what they are really seeking. She is extremely adept at helping buyers identify which cities/zip codes most suit them, then narrowing down neighborhoods, and eventually specific homes. She lives vicariously through the privilege of helping a buyer start a new chapter and says “I feel like I want them to buy a house that I would buy myself.” She helps buyers to look at the overall value proposition when buying a home.</p>
                <p>Wendy’s experience in real estate is enriched by her business background in which she helped grow a travel nursing staffing firm into a multi-million dollar industry leader, founded her own executive search firm, and was a franchisee of a restaurant group. She also had success in the entertainment industry where she produced a feature film (Altered Minds) and worked in Television & Film Talent at ICM Partners.</p>
                <p>Wendy has called Scottsdale home for the last 13 years. She lives in North Scottsdale in an area called Troon with her fiancé, an anesthesi¬ologist, and her 2 children who attend Scottsdale schools.</p>
                <p>Originally from NY and L.A. with a few stints in Nashville, Wendy has a Masters in Music Composition from Claremont Graduate University and a B.S. in both Music & Economics from Vassar College.</p>
