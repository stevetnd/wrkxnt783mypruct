              <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Ranked #2 in sales in 2018 at her brokerage out of more than 700 agents and also VP of Luxury, Wendy is a rising star in the Arizona real estate world. She has handled hundreds of relocations in her career and also has experience in Family Office real estate. She enjoys complex transactions, creative solutions, and working with an intensity and level of care and passion that defines her firm.</p>
                <p>Wendy’s experience in real estate is enriched by her business background where she helped grow a travel nursing staffing firm into a multi-million dollar industry leader, founded her own executive search firm, and was a franchisee of a restaurant group. She also had success in the entertainment industry where she produced a feature film (ALTERED MINDS) and worked in Television & Film Talent at ICM Partners.</p>
                <p>When working with a seller who has entrusted her to sell his/her home, Wendy takes it as seriously as if it was her own home and feels the imperative to get the home sold. She is known for her proactive sales and marketing protocols, and her firm partners with many allied vendors that augment their sales plans.</p>
                <p>When working with a buyer, she has a talent for helping buyers hone in on what they are really seeking. She is adept at helping buyers identify  which cities/zip codes most suit them, then narrowing down neighborhoods, and eventually specific homes.  She lives vicariously through the privilege of helping a buyer start a new chapter and says “I feel like I want them to buy a house that I would buy myself.” She helps buyers to look at the overall value proposition when buying a home.</p>
                <p>Wendy has called Scottsdale home for the last 13 years. Originally from NY and L.A. with a few stints in Nashville, Wendy has a Masters in Music Composition from Claremont Graduate University and a B.S. in both Music & Economics from Vassar College.</p>
