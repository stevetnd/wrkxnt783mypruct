                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>As a Scottsdale Native, I have a real passion for the Valley of the Sun. I started working to obtain my real estate license when I was 18 years old, I graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Human Communication with a Minor in Dance from ASU (Go Devils). I married my Husband Kyle in 2015, a Marine Corps Veteran, and we bought a house of our own together in 2011 where we live with our 2 cats and 2 dogs.</p>
                <p>I grew up engulfed in the business and learned real estate terms, negotiations and policies just as I learned how to ride a bike. I grew up in a real estate family with My Dad as a Broker/Owner and my Mom as the Office Manager of their own Real Estate Company in Scottsdale, AZ. You can certainly say this business is in my blood and I am proud to follow in their footsteps. I have had my real estate license since 2007 and it is so natural for me to enjoy and thrive in this industry. I know the Valley extremely well and I have watched it and local real estate grow and evolve my entire life. My Bachelor’s Degree in Human Communication from Arizona State University gives me the innate ability to clearly and comfortably communicate with you step-by-step processes and educate you in a way that makes you confident that you have someone that can represent and guide you through the process and negotiations of a real estate transaction. I have worked in Event Planning, Property Management, all aspects of Marketing, and I am also a small business owner - this all helps me to successfully run my real estate business where your needs are handled with care, organization, creativity and clarity for the best result.</p>
                <p>I continue to affiliate myself with a real estate brokerage that utilizes every aspect of marketing, technology and resources that are the most up-to-date and superior when it comes to achieving the best results for my clients both locally and internationally. Being a Millennial of course means I understand how to leverage technology to directly benefit my clients via convenience and value; however, I truly lead with my traditional real estate values engrained in me from my parents. Their slogan was ‘Legendary Service with Integrity’ and I truly believe I lead with that mindset.</p>
                <p>My biggest asset is to create strong and long-lasting relationships with my clients that I genuinely care for, want to work hard for and make proud. I pride myself on eliminating many of the potential stresses one can experience in Buying or Selling a home and actually making the process fun! I am happy to go above and beyond and always know that the relationship, honesty, trust and communication come first. Where you call “Home” is after all one of the most important decisions many people make in their lives and my goal is for you to feel like you wouldn’t rather have anyone else by your side for any and all of your real estate needs. I’d love to talk to you more about your specific needs and how my knowledge, and expertise can help you achieve your real estate goals.</p>
