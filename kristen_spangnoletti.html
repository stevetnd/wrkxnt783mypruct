                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I have the honor of being a part of Denver's ever-changing real estate community.  When I began my career almost 2 decades ago, I had no idea where it would take me. It has been the most amazing journey and I believe the best is yet to come!  Each time I help someone make a move; I know that someone's life has been changed because of me.</p>
                <p>The Denver market is a large one and can be overwhelming at times.  Being a full-service Realtor for as many years as I have has provided me with knowledge it takes to be a great guide.  Allowing me to be your coach in the process of buying or selling your home, you can trust that you will be in good hands.  I have participated in extensive trainings with negotiating, contracts, home buying and home selling so combine that with my years of experience and expertise, you can trust that you will be in good hands.</p>
                <p>In my 17+ years of being a Realtor, I have received many designations.  Managing Broker, Certified Negotiator, Certified Luxury Realtor, Ambassador Certification are some of the many. I am also proud to have won many awards throughout my career for being a top producing realtor, independently and with teams.</p>
                <p>Over the past few decades, I have worked with some amazing real estate brokerage firms in the Denver area, but I finally found my home with Exit Realty. Exit Realty is a Canadian Based company which aligns with my beliefs:  “People first”.  They have created a real estate company to support the realtors and our clients.  Exit also believes in finding and creating the most advanced tools, which helps our clients navigate through the real estate process as easily as possible.  In this ever changing and evolving world we live in, it is important to stay on top of the real estate market. Because of that I am able to give buyers and sellers the best advantage while making the big decision to make some major changes.  Our top-notch tools and technology are some of the best in the industry.  Come join me on your journey and see why I believe we are the best around!!</p>
                <p>Along with being a full-service Realtor, I enjoy giving back to our community.  I have connected with many organizations that share my belief in giving.  Women's Counsel of Realtors, The Alliance of Professional Women, and Highlands Ranch serves, are some I work with.  When you work with me, you become a part a community of giving. After all, helping others is what it is all about and I would love for you to be a part of it!</p>
