          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Lonnie D. Daniels, owner and broker in charge of Homes and More Real Estate Services, works to educate home buyers and sellers on the many options open to them. When the time comes to make an investment in real estate – the biggest investment many people will ever make – it’s vitally essential to work with someone who is reputable, relatable  and reliable. Lonnie D. Daniels, owner/ broker in charge of Homes and More Real Estate Services, works diligently to establish the camaraderie, trust and rapport with those that he is servicing.<br>
            <br>
            “It’s all about the relationship,” Daniels says. “Interpersonal skills, morals, values, tact, resilience, tenacity, and grit are all essential, because people buy people, before they buy product.” While many individuals began their home search on the internet, technology will never be able to replace the value of a cultivated relationship, he says. Whether it be the strategic approach of selfless service that was enhanced while serving in the U.S. Army or the leadership ideas/concepts that were instilled in him at the collegiate level, both kinds of knowledge are valuable to the people that he is helping.<br>
            <br>    
            To enable consumers to make intelligent and informed decisions is the foundation from which Homes and More was established. As he works with first-time home buyers, he helps them gain a thorough understanding of the different intricacies of real estate: conventional financing, Federal Housing Administration, Veterans Administration, United States Department of Agriculture-rural housing, South Carolina state housing, underwriting, down payment assistance programs, home warranties, closing costs, debt to income ratios, new home construction, bank owned properties, appraisals, tax sale auctions, home inspections, etc. Lonnie works with sellers, investors, baby boomers, veterans, first-time buyers, banks, and millennials. He is also a member of the Realtor Land Institute. He helps consumers buy, sell, and invest in Ranch Land, Farm Land, Agricultural Land, Transitional Land and Resource Land. He also has a strong international population that he services. Clients from Ghana, India, Jamaica, El Salvador and Puerto Rico are just some of the nationalities that he has helped facilitate assistance in the home-buying process.<br>
            <br>
            Lonnie is also the owner/operator/lead facilitator of the Palmetto Real Estate Academy. The Palmetto Real Estate Academy is a SC Real Estate School that provides students the opportunity to get their real estate license. Lonnie believes that “every tree has roots,” and his success is due to “the great people he has around him.”<br>
            <br>
            Homes and More Real Estate Services and the Palmetto Real Estate Academy places a strong emphasis on Empowerment through Education and Exposure.</p>
