          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Gerard Richardson is a Seasoned Professional with experience not only in Real Estate but also in the Mortgage, Life & Health Insurance Industries. He has held all three State Licenses while managing his Commercial Cleaning company at one point in his career. Due to the overwhelming demands, he had to relinquish the Mortgage License and turn his focus back to his passion for Real Estate and Insurance. For over three decades he has either serviced Insurance or Real Estate Clients. Servicing his clientele is priority number one with him. He is accustomed to working hard and smart at the same time. Organizing and having a heart for meeting people needs are his core values for success.</p>
          <p>As a Real Estate Professional currently with Premier Brokers International Inc., Gerard and his spouse Lurline Richardson currently network with over four hundred and fifty Real Estate Agents within the company. At Premier we all work towards perfecting our trade through education and training of residential and commercial sales, rentals, luxury estates, single family homes, condos, multi-family units, 1st time home buyer programs, buyer representation, short sales, foreclosures, relocations and new construction homes. If our clients want it, we do everything possible to make it happen.</p>
          <p>The most important thing concerning Gerard is that he has perfected his trade through listening to his clients' needs and desires. He structures a strategic plan of action that makes every transaction smooth and stress free. He also offers Buyers and Sellers the perspective of maximizing their purchasing or selling potential on every transaction as well. He continues to stay abreast of the changing trends in the industry and advise his clients in kind.</p>
          <p>Gerard is committed to walking you through every step of the process until completion. Smiling, satisfied faces is his goal as his clientâ€™s dreams unfold before their eyes. Whether it is their first or one hundredth purchase of a sale, rental, commercial or investment opportunity, everyone one of them is still special to Gerard. He hopes that he can be of service and meet you personally.</p>
